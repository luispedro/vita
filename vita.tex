\section{Research Highlights}
\Text

\cvitem[2011]{Proteome-wide Study of Subcellular Location in Mouse Fibroblasts}
I am developing new methods for learning from both a very large collection of
images of fluorescently tagged proteins and other forms of data (sequence
information, database information). This work builds on my past work and is, at
the moment, still unpublished.

\cvitem[2010]{Unsupervised Subcellular Pattern Unmixing}
Many proteins are located in more than one organelle simultaneously, a
phenomenon known as a mixed pattern (the pattern corresponding to a single
organelle being a pure pattern). Recovering the organelle structure from image
data where mixed patterns are present is known as the unsupervised unmixing
problem in subcellular location. I developed new models for
solving this problem. My solution was chosen as one of the highlights of 2010
in computational biology by the journal \emph{Nature Biotechnology}\footnote{
\emph{Trends in computational biology—2010} by H. Craig Mak, Nature
Biotechnology, Vol. 29, No. 1. (January 2011), pp. 45-45
\showdoi{10.1038/nbt.1747}}.

\cvitem[2008-2009]{Structure Literature Image Finder (SLIF)}
SLIF is a search engine that indexes biomedical papers with their images. In
this project, I was responsible for the computer vision aspects of the
processing pipeline. I also handled much of the integration effort of the
several components and coordinated the preparation of the multi-author
publications that resulted from the effort. This project was a finalist in the
Elsevier Grand Challenge (4 teams out of 70 were chosen for the final). I
represented our team in both the final and the semi-final of this competition.

\section{Education}

\cvitem[Summer 2011]{PhD in computational biology, Carnegie Mellon University}
Dissertation topic: \emph{Modeling the Space of Subcellular Location Patterns
Using Images and Other Sources of Information}, advised by Prof.\ Robert F.
Murphy.

\cvitem[2006]{MS in computer science, Instituto Superior T\'ecnico (Technical University Lisbon)}
Dissertation topic: \emph{Bayesian Network Parameter Estimation Using Noisy
Observations or Soft Evidence}, advised by Prof.\ Arlindo Oliveira.

\cvitem[2004]{BS in computer science, Instituto Superior T\'ecnico (Technical University Lisbon)}
Finished top of my class.

\section{Teaching Experience}

\cvitem[2011]{Practical Tutorial in Lisbon Machine Learning Summer School}

\cvitem[2009]{Programming for Scientists}
I designed and taught a semester-long course on computer programming for
scientists at Carnegie Mellon University. This course was not based on any
existing course at CMU, but resulted from a need I identified in biomedical or
physical scientists who, as part of their job, have a need to program.

\cvitem[2008]{Teaching Assistant for Laboratory Methods for Computational Biologists (CMU)}
\cvitem[2005]{Introduction to Computers Course in Cac\'em}
I co-developed and co-taught an introductory course in computer usage in
Cac\'em, an underprivileged neighbourhood near Lisbon. This was pro-bono work.

\cvitem[2005]{Teaching Assistant for Decision Support Systems (IST)}

\section{Other Research Projects}

\cvitem[2005-2006]{Approximate String Indexing}
An approximate string index is a data structure that allows for fast string
queries where the matches may be approximate. I developed one such index, the
\emph{dotted suffix tree}.

\section{Scholarships \&\ Awards}

\cvitem[2007-2011]{PhD. Scholarship from Portuguese Science Foundation}
\cvitem[2009]{Joint CMU-U. of Pittsburgh PhD.\ in Computational Biology Research Excellence Award}
\cvitem[2008]{Joint CMU-U. of Pittsburgh PhD.\ in Computational Biology Academic Excellence Award}
\cvitem[2006]{Fulbright Fellow}
\cvitem[2005]{Scholarship from Portuguese Science Foundation}
\cvitem[2004]{Second Prize in \emph{Lisboa \`a Letra} short story competition}
\cvitem[2001]{Instituto Superior T\'ecnico (IST) Academic Excellence Award}

\section{Organisational Experience}

\cvitem[2010]{Local Committee for Portuguese-American Postgraduate Society National Forum}
I headed the local organising committee for this the 2010 edition of this
annual event. It took place in Pittsburgh and included, as speakers,
cabinet-level Portuguese government officials, renowned researchers, artists,
as well as participants from all around the US.

\cvitem[2010]{Beira Project}
With Rita Reis, I started the Beira Project. We spent two months as volunteers
in Beira (Mozambique) working with organisations that provide public health
information and services, mostly relating to \textsc{hiv}. We had also held
organised successful fund-raising activities for our partner organisations in
Mozambique.

\cvitem[2002-2004]{Producer for IST Theatre Group}
I acted as the producer for the IST Theatre Group, which is one of the top
university theatre groups in Portugal. We participated in several festival,
including international festivals. As producer, my activities included
fund-raising and management.

\section{Other Experience}

\cvitem{Open Source Software}
I have released several important open source packages related to my research
work, namely in the areas of \textbf{machine learning} and \textbf{computer
vision}. Previously, I was a \textsc{kde} developer. The \textsc{kde} project
is one of the largest open-source projects in the world with several hundred
developers and over one million lines of code.

\section{Skills}

\cvitem{Computer Programming}
I am an experienced programmer in several languages including \textbf{C},
\textbf{C\raisebox{.1em}{\tiny \bf ++}}, \textbf{Python}, \textbf{Matlab}, and
\textbf{Haskell}.

\cvitem{Cell Culture \& Imaging}
As part of my doctoral research, I was responsible for \textbf{fluorescent
imaging} of cultured cells.

\cvitem{Language Skills}
I am bilingual in \textbf{English} and \textbf{Portuguese}. I speak and write
fluent \textbf{German} (I attended a German high-school and the Technical
University of Vienna) and speak fluent \textbf{French} (I have lived for a in
France).
